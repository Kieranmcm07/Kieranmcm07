### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nixin72/nixin72/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Kieran:

---
**`Software Development (Developer/Creator/Coding)`**

A precise high school student who aims to be a Software Engineer with a focus on Python and more recently C. Familiar with Python, HTML, and CSS and moderate experience in JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. I am interested in programming and always wanting to know more about software engineering other than web programming languages.

I am the type of person who enjoys resolving challenges, developing solutions, and inventing useful devices. Although I made my beginnings in easy environments such as Replit and [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw), today I concentrate on more advanced areas of software engineering, such as algorithms, data structures, and systems programming.

Some of the things I am willing to offer include gameplay, technical talk, and coding games. In the future, I hope to encourage people by creating images based on technology but not limited to web development.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Kieran's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I suppose at the age of eight, every other child was engrossed in cartoons. As for me, it was Scratch that I found most enthralling. The drive to create was no longer about squishy plastic blocks; they were colourful ‚Äòcode‚Äô blocks. I recall the joy that came with developing my very first game, a game in which one races against time, overcoming merciless obstacles to gather a fabulous number of stars. Each level accomplished cemented the illusion: with code, anything I conceived, I could create it.

‚ÄòWhat a web!‚Äô I thought ‚Äì even before I turned eleven, it had become heavier than me. I was immersed in web design; learning HTML and CSS. I quite remember how I spent weeks trying to figure out how to centre a big image on my first site which happened to be my neon green tribute to a favourite band. It was frustrating, but the time when I managed to centre that damn image was pure magic. So the web was not just any other place that could be visited; it was a place that could be created.

There was my new pleasant challenge at thirteen ‚Äì Python. The colourful blocks had disappeared. There were just lines of code, which looked like hieroglyphics at the start. But it was worth the struggle. Algorithms were something that I embraced fully. I went to the extent of creating software that could solve simple substitution cyphers, which was a code translator for kids who wanted to be spies. Cool-looking applications were not the goal of Python. Rather, it was utilizing that logic and crafting something with great effectiveness.

And now, the journey takes new turns and new routes. JavaScript is the rope that dangles the desired bait allowing interactivity to my websites using motion and user input. C, however, takes you under the bonnet to show you the inner workings of the circuitry. There is an element of difficulty in it, similar to that of understanding an alien language, but every single code I struggle with and win helps me get an inch closer to the actual workings of computers.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) has accompanied me in this adventure. Starting from simple projects and debugging, and up to complex project management, VS Code kept pace with me. A couple of years ago, it still did not exist.
