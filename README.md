**`Aspiring Software Engineer (Developer • Creator • Problem Solver)`**

I'm a focused high school student with a passion for software development and a growing skill set in Python, C, and web technologies. My journey started with block-based programming and has evolved into a love for building solutions through code—whether it's crafting a game, automating a task, or solving real-world problems.

I'm curious about everything beyond basic web development—especially algorithms, data structures, and system-level programming. I thrive on challenges, and I'm always keen to deepen my understanding of software engineering.

🧠 Self-taught. 🧩 Solution-driven. 🚀 Future-focused.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>

At eight years old, while others were watching cartoons, I was captivated by Scratch. Those colourful code blocks felt like magic. I vividly remember my first game—racing against time to collect stars. It was simple, but it sparked something deeper.

By age eleven, I ventured into web development with HTML and CSS. I spent hours figuring out how to centre a big image. When I finally did, it felt like wizardry. The web wasn't just a place to visit—it was a space I could build.

At thirteen, I dived into Python. Gone were the colourful blocks—now it was pure text, logic, and structure. I loved it. I even built a cipher-solving app for kids who wanted to be secret agents.

Today, I continue my journey with system-level programming and more advanced languages like C. I still love building games and technical tools, but now I focus on learning deeper concepts: memory management, data structures, and algorithms.
