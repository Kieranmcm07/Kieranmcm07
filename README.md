**Aspiring Software Engineer | Curious Problem Solver | Practical Builder**

I'm a self-taught developer based in Scotland, with conditional offers to study Software Engineering at university. Iâ€™ve always been drawn to how things work under the hoodâ€”whether it's in websites, systems, or everyday tools.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve built a solid foundation in Python, HTML, and CSS, and have been expanding into JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. I enjoy designing projects that are both useful and technically interesting. Right now, Iâ€™m learning Java to prepare for university and exploring how to write cleaner, more efficient code.

  <summary><strong>ðŸ“– My Coding Journey</strong></summary>

My coding journey began with Scratch when I was 8 years oldâ€”those colorful blocks introduced me to the logic behind software. By 11, I was creating websites using HTML and CSS, and by 13, Iâ€™d moved on to Python.

Since then, Iâ€™ve continued to learn and build, experimenting with web projects, small games, and backend tools. Iâ€™ve added JavaScript, PHP, and some MySQL to my skill set along the way. Recently, Iâ€™ve started learning Java to better understand object-oriented programming in preparation for university.

I enjoy building things that solve problems or teach me something newâ€”and Iâ€™m excited to keep growing as a developer.
