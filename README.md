A normal highschool kid where he works at his hardest to become an Software Engineer working with Python and starting to learn C. Great experiance with Python and HTML&CSS. Also more in the **toolbox** below.

I love creating programs as im planning to create tech content in the future, mostly on learning web developement and a simple little bit of JavaScript. **But** I also talk about other topics than just coding like games. I advice you follow me to stay up to date with my content.

I managed to start my coding journey with my [Replit Account](https://replit.com/@Nokky07) and by watching first first Python tutorial, by [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw). In which from this I have advanced my Python coding skills. Looking foward to helping lots of people with my knowledge.
