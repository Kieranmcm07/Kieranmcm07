**Aspiring Software Engineer | Passionate Problem Solver | Always Learning**

I recently finished high school and have a conditional offer to study Software Engineering at university. I started coding young with Scratch and quickly became hooked on the idea of building things from logic alone. Over time, I moved into real programming with **Python**, and later expanded into **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and some **PHP**/**MySQL**.

I enjoy creating projects that are practical, creative, and sometimes just for fun. Right now, Iâ€™m learning **Java** in preparation for university and getting more comfortable with backend logic, data structures, and algorithms.

  <summary><strong>ðŸ“˜ My Coding Journey</strong></summary>

I first got into coding at age 8 through Scratch. I loved how simple blocks could make something interactive. At 11, I built my first website with HTML and CSSâ€”and spent hours figuring out how to center an image.

By 13, I had discovered Python and started building small tools and games. I explored JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL to expand my projects and understand how the web works.

Now, Iâ€™m learning Java and focusing more on backend development, systems thinking, and data handling. I enjoy tackling problems, learning how things work at a deeper level, and building software that actually solves something.
